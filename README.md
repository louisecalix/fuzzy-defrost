# Fuzzy Logic Defrosting

An overview of frost buildup levels, temperature ranges inside and outside, and door opening frequencies. It is designed to help you assess and manage refrigerator defrosting needs.

## Frost Buildup

- **Thin:** Less than 2 mm
- **Medium:** 2 - 5 mm
- **Thick:** More than 5 mm

## Temperature Inside

- **1 Very Cold:** -18 to -8°C or 0 to 17°F
- **2 Cold:** -10 to -1°C or 30 to 14°F
- **3 Moderate:** 0 to 10°C or 32 to 50°F

## Door Opening Frequency

- **1 Rarely:** Less than 5 times/day
- **2 Occasionally:** 5-7 times/day
- **3 Frequently:** 8-10 times/day

## Temperature Outside

- **1 Cold:** Below 20°C or 68°F
- **2 Moderate:** Between 20°C and 30°C or between 68°F and 86°F
- **3 Warm:** Above 30°C or 86°F


## Rules Table
<!-- 
| Frost Buildup | Temp Inside | Door Opening Freq. | Temp Outside | Defrost Cycle (Output) |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1 Thin        | Very Cold   | Rarely             | Cold         | No Defrost             |
| 2 Thin        | Very Cold   | Occasionally       | Moderate     | No Defrost             |
| 3 Medium      | Cold        | Occasionally       | Moderate     | Short Defrost Cycle    |
| 4 Medium      | Cold        | Frequently         | Warm         | Long Defrost Cycle     |
| 5 Thick       | Cold        | Occasionally       | Warm         | Long Defrost Cycle     |
| 6 Thick       | Moderate    | Frequently         | Warm         | Long Defrost Cycle     |
| 7 Thick       | Moderate    | Frequently         | Moderate     | Long Defrost Cycle     |
| 8 Very Thick  | Cold        | Rarely             | Cold         | Short Defrost Cycle    |
